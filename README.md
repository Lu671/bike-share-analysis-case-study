# bike-share-analysis-case-study
In this hypothetical scenario, I am as a junior data analyst tasked with developing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members for a fictional bike-share program in Chicago.
I will follow the data analysis process—Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act—to analyze historical bike trip data, identify usage patterns, and provide actionable recommendations.
